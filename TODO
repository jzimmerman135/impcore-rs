lazy function loading? attempt 1 do it without llvm

- when given a function definition F
    - which has no unmet dependencies
      - remove F from the lazy graph (if possible)
      - compile all other vertices in lazy table that have no edges 
        and add them to the function table 
      - compile F and add to function table
    - which has unmet dependencies A, B
      - add A, B to the lazy graph
      - if it already exists in the lazy graph make sure it is still connected
        - update add edges to A, B
      - if it does not exist in lazy graph
        - add F and connect it to A, B
      - don't try to compile it

- when given a global G
    - try remove G from the lazy table
    - compile all other vertices in lazy table that have no edges 
        and add them to the function table 

- when calling a function
    - check the function table
        if unbound ask the lazy table why
